JavaScript Fundamentals: Console Finances

##Objective

The objective of this JavaScript challenge was to derive and manipulate a dataset. It involved generating a secondary array and figuring out how to create variables in order to extract information from the array. I found this challenge particularly difficult but that created an opportunity for learning which has expanded my understanding of JavaScript in general, not just when it comes to analysing statistical data.
